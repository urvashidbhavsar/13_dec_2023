    <h4>Development</h4>
    <p>
        In <big style="color: blue;">1980</big>, physicist <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>, a contractor at <abbr title="abc">CERN</abbr>, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers
        to use and share documents. In <big style="color: blue;">1989</big>, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3]
        Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late <big style="color: blue;">1990</big>. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data
        systems engineer <u><strong>Robert Cailliau</strong></u> collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted
        by CERN. In his personal notes of <big style="color: blue;">1990</big>, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an
        encyclopedia is the first entry.<sup>[4]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet
        by Tim Berners-Lee in late <big style="color: blue;">1991</big>.[6][7] It describes 18 elements <del>comprising</del> the initial, relatively simple design of
        HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house <mark>Standard Generalized Markup
        Language</mark> (<a href="#">SGML</a>)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.<sup>[8]</sup>. code is : <code>&lt;html&gt;.... &lt;/html&gt;</code>
